# Sorting-Visualizer
The project is a website designed to visualize the various sorting algorithms.
The different sorting algorithms which are demonstrated here are --
1. Bubble sort.
2. Selection sort.
3. Insertion sort.
4. Merge sort.
5. Quick sort.
6. Heap sort.
The different size of the array can be set and the speed can also be set. The user inerface is very easy to navigate.
